# Titanic_Data_Analysis
# Content
In this project I'm attempting to do data analysis on the Titanic Dataset. In the first step I'm doing a very quick data exploration and preprocessing on a visual level, plotting some simple plots to understand the data better. Then I've done some data cleaning and built a Classifier that can predict whether a passenger survived or not.
# Results
we get an average accuracy of 77.44 %. This is a pretty good accuracy for starters and could be improved upon by coming up with newer, better features by using some feature engineering. This is something I could work on in the future.
